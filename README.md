## üåü Introduction

**Genius LangGraph** is a powerful AI agent designed for in-depth research and automated report generation. It leverages multiple tools like web search, academic paper retrieval, and vector search to gather and synthesize information on complex topics.

This project demonstrates the use of **LangGraph**, a framework for building stateful, multi-step AI applications. By integrating LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and knowledge bases like arXiv and Pinecone, this agent can autonomously navigate complex topics and produce coherent, structured reports.

## üöÄ Features

- üîç **Multi-source Research**: Combines information from arXiv, web search, and vector-based knowledge bases  
- üß† **Intelligent Decision Making**: Uses an Oracle LLM to determine the most suitable research tools  
- üîÑ **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Selects and executes tools based on context and task  
- üìÑ **Comprehensive Report Generation**: Outputs detailed reports with introduction, methodology, findings, and references  
- üßµ **Stateful Conversations**: Maintains context throughout the research process  
- üìà **Graph-based Workflow Visualization**: Visualizes the agent's decision flow using Graphviz

```

## üîç How It Works

1. **User Query**: The user submits a research prompt.
2. **Oracle Decision**: The Oracle LLM analyzes the input and selects the most appropriate tool.
3. **Tool Execution**: One of the following is executed:
   - **RAG Search**: Retrieves relevant documents using Pinecone.
   - **Web Search**: Performs Google search using SerpAPI.
   - **arXiv Fetch**: Pulls academic abstracts from arXiv.
4. **Iterative Research**: The system gathers information in steps.
5. **Synthesis & Reporting**: Combines findings into a structured report.
6. **Final Output**: Presents a well-structured report including all research steps and sources.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Genius-LangGraph.git
cd Genius-LangGraph

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Set up environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
export PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key"
export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your_serpapi_api_key"
```

## üéÆ Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Genius LangGraph.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells to initialize the agent and supporting tools.

3. Submit a query using:
   ```python
   out = runnable.invoke({
       "input": "What are the latest advancements in quantum computing?",
       "chat_history": []
   })

   print(build_report(output=out["intermediate_steps"][-1].tool_input))
   ```
